ImageProcessor
==============

ImageProcessor is a C# Console Application that compares two similar images and outputs another image with the differences highlighted.


Example 
-------

ImageProcess will compare an image ("Compare_A.jpg")...

![alt text](https://github.com/mattchoinski/ImageProcessor/raw/master/bin/Compare_A.jpg "Compare A")

...with a similar image ("Compare_B.jpg")...

![alt text](https://github.com/mattchoinski/ImageProcessor/raw/master/bin/Compare_B.jpg "Compare B")

..and output another image with the differences highlighted ("AnalyzedImage.bmp"):

![alt text](https://github.com/mattchoinski/ImageProcessor/raw/master/bin/AnalyzedImage.bmp "Analyzed Image")

With the example images above, ImageProcess created the analyzed image well within a second (usually under 0.15 seconds).
